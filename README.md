# Dirty Data Project

## Project description

This project is an individual project assigned during the CodeClan _Professional Data Analysis_ Course.

One of the most common sayings you will likely hear for anyone working as a data analyst/scientist ‘80% of your time is data cleaning’ - this can include (but is not limited to!) loading all your data in to a single tool for analysis; dealing with missing values; duplicates and outliers; cleaning strings; reshaping and joining.

__Goal of this project task is to clean and analyse a raw "dirty" dataset in order to answer 
several questions regarding the data.__
